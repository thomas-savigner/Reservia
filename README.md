# Reservia - Mockup to Website Conversion

This project involves converting provided design mockups (desktop and mobile) for a fictional vacation planning website, "Reservia", into a functional static web page using only HTML and CSS. This was completed as an initial project during an internship following a web development training program.

## Project Overview

The goal was to accurately replicate the visual design and layout of the mockups for both desktop and mobile screen sizes, ensuring a responsive user experience. The focus was on structuring the content semantically with HTML and styling it appropriately with CSS, adhering to specific technical constraints.

## Features

*   **HTML5 & CSS3:** Built using modern web standards.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile specified, tablet view flexible).
*   **Flexbox Layout:** Uses CSS Flexbox for page structure and element positioning.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Employs meaningful HTML tags for better structure and accessibility.
*   **W3C Validated:** Code checked against W3C validation standards.
*   **No Frameworks/Preprocessors:** Developed purely with vanilla HTML and CSS.
*   **Custom Styling:** Implements the provided color palette and Raleway font.
*   **Font Awesome Icons:** Integrates icons from the Font Awesome library.

## Live Demo

A live version of the site is deployed on GitHub Pages:

Desktop View | Mobile View

## Technical Constraints

*   Implement desktop and mobile views based on mockups.
*   Use appropriate media query breakpoints for responsiveness.
*   Utilize Flexbox for layout (CSS Grid was disallowed).
*   Write code from scratch without CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) or preprocessors (like Sass).
*   Ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.
*   Use Git for version control and host the repository on GitHub/GitLab.
*   Deploy the final page using GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (including Flexbox)
*   Git
*   GitHub / GitHub Pages
*   Font Awesome
